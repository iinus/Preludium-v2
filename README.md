# Preludium

Investa is a mobile application for e-learning and investment.

## Prerequisites

- Node
- Expo

See this page to install Node on MAC: https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html

Download the **Expo client** mobile app in App Store or Google Play Store. This will allow you to test the application on your phone.

## Installation

Use npm to install all dependencies (in the project directory)

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

To run the application locally, run this command in the terminal

```bash
npm run start
```

## Test

When you run the app locally, a QR code will appear, both in the terminal or at http://localhost:19002/ in a browser.
Use this QR code to test the mobile app on your phone. You will need to have the Expo client app installed first.
